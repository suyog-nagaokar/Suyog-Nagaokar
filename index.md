# h1 SnowPro Core Certified !
# h2 Certified Big Data Engineer - IIT Roorkee

I am a purveyor of competitive intelligence and holistic analyses of Big Data,
A passionate Hadoop and Spark Developer / Architect leveraging Big data and Cloud technology to help businesses understand their customers' behavior and generate meaningful insights to elevate the revenue.

My most exciting work to date was successful implementation of Customer Genome on Azure platform and Real Time Anti-Fraud projects for Banking domain and Packaged Analytics models for predicting Churn/best offers for Telecom operators which created an enormous buzz in the respective organizations.

While I enjoy all aspects of my job, I think my favorite stage of a project is working with the client or business stakeholders to understand the business objectives. As we go through that collaborative process, the ideas start to flow and that’s always the fun part.

I strongly believe -
